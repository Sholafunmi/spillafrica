                    SPILL [Speaking Intelligently, Ladies Lead] is a pan-African speaking platform dedicated to women of African descent 
                    to share their authentic stories and ideas of value for developmental purposes. Organized by Blue Velocity Media & 
                    Entertainment Limited, it is part of a broader agenda to empower and catalyze women to own their significance, 
                    thus promoting a more functional society that benefits from the female resource within it.
                </p>

                        SPILL focuses on amplifying the voices of women in Nigeria and continental Africa as well as 
                        providing extensive learning opportunities for them. From deepening Intra-gender relations 
                        through building productive and enterprising female figures to promoting personal development, 
                        SPILL embodies these realities.
                        The first SPILL with the theme The Possibility for Transformation was held in Lagos, Nigeria, 
                        in 2017. Thereafter, it has held consistently in Lagos and moved on to Accra, Ghana, in 2019. 
                        
                        However, the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown put paid to the Lagos 2020 edition with the theme Not 
                        That Kind of Pink. This edition of SPILL in Lagos is our comeback after the pandemic, and it 
                        promises to be the most interesting and impactful so far.

                        Our mission is to mainstream the voice of the African woman through storytelling and ideas-sharing 
                        in order to achieve social equilibrium, social development and human empowerment.
                        Our vision is to midwife a new generation of confident African women who are empowered to deploy their
                         natural giftedness and acquired competencies, first in self-affirmation and then in contribution to 
                         social well-being and development.

<!-- ABOUT SPILL
SPILL [Speaking Intelligently, Ladies Lead] is a pan-African speaking platform dedicated to women of African descent to share their authentic stories and ideas of value for developmental purposes. Organized by Blue Velocity Media & Entertainment Limited, it is part of a broader agenda to empower and catalyze women to own their significance, thus promoting a more functional society that benefits from the female resource within it. SPILL focuses on amplifying the voices of women in Nigeria and continental Africa as well as providing extensive learning opportunities for them. From deepening Intra-gender relations through building productive and enterprising female figures to promoting personal development, SPILL embodies these realities.
The first SPILL with the theme The Possibility for Transformation was held in Lagos, Nigeria, in 2017. Thereafter, it has held consistently in Lagos and moved on to Accra, Ghana, in 2019. However, the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown put paid to the Lagos 2020 edition with the theme Not That Kind of Pink. This edition of SPILL in Lagos is our comeback after the pandemic, and it promises to be the most interesting and impactful so far.
Our mission is to mainstream the voice of the African woman through storytelling and ideas-sharing in order to achieve social equilibrium, social development and human empowerment.
Our vision is to midwife a new generation of confident African women who are empowered to deploy their natural giftedness and acquired competencies, first in self-affirmation and then in contribution to social well-being and development.
Objectives:
To educate the African woman into leadership in her constituencies
To inspire change in the behaviour of society towards women and women's issues
To affirm and empower women towards contributing to life and society.
To provoke a rethink of known ideas and challenge stereotypes that get in the way of the common good.
To promote the art of STORYTELLING and personal confidence
To create a new hub for LEARNING and entertainment as well as for the exchange of potent ideas.
To promote PRODUCTIVITY through inspirational conversations
